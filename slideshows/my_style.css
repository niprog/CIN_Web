/*
This is the stylesheet where you can do your personal settings - 
You find the most important settings to adapt the colors of your gallery! 

I recommend not to modify the style.css because if I upgrade you can still
use your stylesheet! copy the stuff you change into this css. The settings
in this file overwrite the default settings!
Remove this file if you don't use it because otherwise its transfered to the server!


I recommend to use the color manager in he backend to get a first draft.
This will be saved in this file! Then you can start from there!
