			<h2>Success Stories</h2>
			<p>The members of Cavaliers in Need have many dogs in the short time the group has existed, as of May 2014 the number of rescued cavaliers stands at X. We also 
			wanted to share some of the groups stories with everyone through these pages</p>

			<td colspan="2"><h2>Lady</h2>On the 2nd May 2014 a beautiful girl called Lady, a tri colour aged 3, came to us. Lady is from Enniskillen and 
			her owner was away most of the day so she was taken into the care of c.i.n. We were meant to be fostering her for a week while her other foster went on holiday,
			but after 5 mins with her we knew she had to come and live with us permanently. Our other 3 cavaliers took to 
			her immediately and are now best of friends. We adore this beautiful girl and it feels like she has been here forever, she is so special and brings so much joy to our lives.</td>

			<h2>Love at first sight</h2>
			Friday 15th November we met Cath on our way to the Pet Expo and with her was the most gorgeous pup I have ever seen. We went to say hello and I got a massive kiss. There and then we knew we wanted this boy but he was going to another family. I was very upset on the Monday as I thought of him going to his new family. So when I heard Cath’s voice saying there had been a change of plan and were we still interested I had to pull the car over as I just couldn’t drive through the happy tears.
			Six months later and I wonder what life was ever like before Bailey. I am so thankful and indebted to Julie and her husband who got him out of his old life, where they thought it was reasonable to pull him by the back legs down the stairs, Diane and Joanne who then looked after him and to Cath for bringing Bailey back to Northern Ireland as he completes our family. He is the most loving, lively and goofiest dog I have met. He always comes when you ask for a kiss and has brought out the ‘pup’ in Louis, as he rarely played before. I just can’t imagine why anyone would want to get rid of this wonderful pup. He is a real character with bundles of energy and is in to absolutely everything and definitely keeps us on our toes! CIN has given him the chance to live life to the full and Bailey is making the most of it.
